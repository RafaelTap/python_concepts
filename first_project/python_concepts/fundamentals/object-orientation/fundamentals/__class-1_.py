# python oriented to object

"""
object orientation is a counterpoint to structured programming ( programming based in
looping, for, if, while ...)

object is any element from real world (person, ball, car )

Abstraction: leave aside what is not relevant
Attributes: properties from real world that describe an object (name, age, color...)
values: is the attribute content
operations and behavior: mention what the object can do
interface: operations of an object that let change the state of attributes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> CLASS CONCEPT <<

Class is the base of programming oriented tp object, work as a mold to create an object,
define attribute(data), methods(behavior) of objects created from the class.

Class describe characteristics and behavior of a set of objects. Each object is from a class,
and have attributes and operation of the class.

The name of archive.py most be the same of inside the archive

>> ENCAPSULATION CONCEPT <<

is the idea of hide the internal implementation of a class or object and supply only the
external interface to interation with it. In python the encapsulation is used through exclusive
words (public, private, protected).

HERITAGE AND POLYMORPHISM CONCEPTS

inheritance allows that classes(subclasses) extends attributes and behaviors of origin class
(superclass). The subclasses can add news attributes and behaviors.

-> simple heritage: when a subclass inherits characteristics that exist only in one super class
-> multiple heritage: when a subclass inherits characteristics from two or more superclasses.

Polymorphism is the ability to have the same different behavior in different classes.

-> overload: the many methods with the same name, but different signatures.
-> subtyping: when a subclass can be used as a superclass. It's possible through heritage and
method implementation described in superclass for subclass.
